# ðŸŒ¤ Weather Station

Chapter Two exercise - a weather station display strucute. All displays are observing the central Weather Station, in such a way that when the Weather Station updates its measurements, the displays are notified, pull the values they need and print them in terminal. This is done by using the **Observer Pattern**.

**note**: in this code, only the "current conditions display" and the "heat index display" are implemented. The others are not, because I am lazy.

## ðŸ‘€ The Observer Pattern

"*Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.*"
